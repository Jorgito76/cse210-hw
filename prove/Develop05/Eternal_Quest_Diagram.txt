Classes Needed:

Program -> 
The Program class acts as the entry point of the application, managing user interaction and the main execution loop.

Goal (Abstract Base Class) ->
Defines the core structure for all goals.
Stores common attributes and provides essential methods for goal execution.

SimpleGoal (Inherits from Goal) ->
A goal that can be marked complete, rewarding the user with points.
Implements the RecordEvent method for completion.

EternalGoal (Inherits from Goal) ->
A goal that is never complete but accumulates points each time it is recorded.
Implements the RecordEvent method to track multiple completions.

ChecklistGoal (Inherits from Goal) ->
A goal that must be completed a certain number of times before being finished.
Tracks progress and grants a bonus upon completion.

Menu ->
Displays menu options for goal management.
Allows the user to create goals, record progress, and view status.
